      <h3>Think Global, Act Local Philosophy</h3>
    <p> We tried a lot of approaches to solve the issues which are plaguing the current system. After researching on several environmental science methodologies, we realized that environmental science can be best taught by actually doing it. This led us to develop the philosophy "Think Global, Act Local ".

<li><h4>Think Global </h4></li>
<p> It is very important for young students to understand Nature on a global scale. In fact, one of the core aims of environmental science is to let learners realize that they are a small part of a bigger system which is interconnected in complex ways. We implement this philosophy by providing users with large amount of global environmental datasets using advanced data visualization techniques and interactive infographics. This empowers the learner to get the bigger picture of the whole environement and determine his role in the ecosystem. </p>
<li> <h4>Act Local </h4>
<p> While it is very important to understand the Nature at a global scale, the chain is still left incomplete if it is not supplemented by a practical approach. This is where the "Act Local" philosophy comes into picture. We try to get the learner outdoors and allow him to apply his theoretical learning in real life. We collaborate with environmental science teachers to achieve this. We believe in the power of technology, but at the same time we understand that it can never replace the teacher."
